Concept: A guided text editor that compiles user input into a concise, categorized marketing plan. This app will also display data pulled from multiple Census Bureau APIs to provide the user with data relevant to the locality of their marketing plan.

                            Base Features:

- Users may create an account with userID and password to store and access created plans.

- Users may create marketing plans by responding to simple, section-by-section prompts. Users will then have their input compiled into a single-page document that represents a concise marketing plan containing their entered data.

- App will contain a component allowing users to fetch specific data from multiple Census Bureau APIs; ideally this data would be useful in catering to specific goals or localities within marketing initiatives. APIs are currently planned to be api.census.gov/data/2017/ecnbasic and api.census.gov/data/timeseries/eits/
